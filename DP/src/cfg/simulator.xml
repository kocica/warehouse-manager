        toteSpeed ................. How fast tote moves on conveyor [m/sec]
        workerSpeed ............... How fast worker moves during picking [m/sec]
        totesPerMin ............... How many totes/orders are shipped [totes/min]
        speedup ................... Fasten up / slow down simulation time
        locationCapacity .......... How many totes can be processed at the same time
        conveyorCapacity .......... How many totes can be transported at the same time
        orderRequestInterval ...... Interval in which new orders are started [secs]

        replenishment ............. Work with quantities and replenish depleted articles
        initialSlotQuantity ....... How many products are stored within each slot
        replenishmentQuantity ..... How many products (minimum) will be replenished
        replenishmentThreshold .... In case quantity is below this level, replenishment is initiated

        preprocessing ............. Preprocess order lines to fasten up the picking process
                                    "none"      - no preprocessing
                                    "normal"    - simple sorting rule based on Manhattan distances
                                    "optimized" - complex sorting based on ant colony optimization
